The Registration System with User Management is a Python application developed using tkinter, which provides a comprehensive platform for user registration, user management, and data storage in CSV files. This system is designed to handle the registration of users, including their personal information, and offers advanced features such as user deletion and data visualization through a tkinter Treeview.

## Project Features

### User Registration

- Users can register by providing their personal information, such as name, email, and contact details.
- The system validates user inputs and ensures data integrity.

### User Management

- Registered users are stored in a CSV file for easy retrieval and management.
- Administrators can view, add, and delete user records.
- Advanced search and filtering options are available.

### CSV Data Storage

- User data is stored in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files for efficient data management.
- This format ensures compatibility with various spreadsheet software.

### Data Visualization (Treeview)

- The tkinter Treeview widget is used to display user data in a tabular format.
- It offers sorting and searching capabilities for user records.

### User Deletion

- Administrators can delete user records as needed.
- Deletion is implemented with data safety measures in place.

### Data Export

- The system provides an option to export user data to a CSV file for external use or backup.
